Prumo is a set of choices a team has already made, packaged so that starting a new TypeScript
project does not mean making them all over again. Which framework, how a module is laid out, where
the database rules live, how authentication is wired, what a test is allowed to assume: each of
those was decided once, written down with the reasoning and with what the choice costs, and then
turned into something that actually runs.

Put briefly, Prumo is the validation of a well built project without heavy architectural
bureaucracy, done up front instead of discovered three months in. Well built here does not mean
heavily layered. Every choice follows what the framework itself already indicates, so there are no
ports, no adapters, and no in house architecture to learn before writing the first endpoint.

A new project receives two things. The first is code that already works: installed, wired together,
and proven by starting rather than by compiling. The second is a `.prumo/` folder holding the
conventions that code follows. Any AI assistant working in that repository reads the folder and
knows the rules without anyone explaining them, which is the whole point: **the conventions live in
the project, not in someone's head.**

Applications differ, so the choices are not one fixed bundle. Three answers shape what arrives:
which artefacts the project has, whether they sit alone or in one workspace, and whether the
application serves several tenants. The same body of decisions covers an API on its own and a
workspace holding four applications, without either one carrying rules it has no use for.

## Requirements

Node 22.17 or later, pnpm, and Docker for anything with an API. `prumo doctor` checks all of it.

## Running it

```sh
npx @stjoseph/prumo new my-app        # npm
pnpm dlx @stjoseph/prumo new my-app   # pnpm
```

Either runner starts it, and the generated project installs with pnpm, which it needs anyway. The
published package is [`@stjoseph/prumo`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@stjoseph/prumo), and the
command it installs is `prumo`.

It asks what to build, writes the project into `my-app/`, runs `git init`, and installs. Nothing is
committed, so the first commit is yours and the diff shows everything Prumo wrote.

Every question also has a flag, which is how CI runs it without a terminal. Outside an interactive
terminal a missing answer is an error rather than a default, so nothing important gets decided by
silence:

```sh
npx @stjoseph/prumo new my-app --types api,web --single-tenant
```

| Flag | What it answers |
|---|---|
| `--types api,web,mobile,site` | What the project contains. More than one type makes a workspace |
| `--alone` or `--monorepo` | How a single type is laid out |
| `--multi-tenant` or `--single-tenant` | Whether the application serves several tenants |
| `--skip-install` | Stops after writing the files |

## Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `prumo new [name]` | Generates a project |
| `prumo db` | Inside a project with an API: creates the development database in Docker and writes its URL into `.env` |
| `prumo clean` | Removes what the project needed only once, today the database setup, once the database exists |
| `prumo doctor` | Checks Node, pnpm, git and Docker on this machine |
| `prumo version` · `--version` · `-v` | Prints the CLI version |
| `prumo help [command]` · `--help` | Lists the commands, or describes one |

Every command takes `--json`: stdout then holds exactly one document, `{ "ok": true, "command", "data" }` or
`{ "ok": false, "command", "error": { "code", "message" } }`, anything written for a person goes to stderr, nothing
is asked, and the exit code is 0 only when `ok` is true.

## What it generates

| Type | What you get |
|---|---|
| `api` | NestJS, MikroORM on PostgreSQL, Better Auth in a schema of its own, Swagger, Vitest with Testcontainers |
| `web` | Vite, React, TanStack Router and Query, Tailwind, shadcn/ui, forms validated with Zod |
| `mobile` | Expo with Expo Router, NativeWind, MMKV, and the session kept in `expo-secure-store` |
| `site` | Next on the App Router, static by default, for pages that have to be indexed |

One type produces that project on its own. Several produce a pnpm workspace: each application under
`apps/`, the wire contract shared through `packages/api-contract` so a change on one side breaks the
other at typecheck, and one version per dependency held in a catalog.

Every template is committed here in full, and none of them is generated by calling somebody else's
scaffolder at install time. Each one installs, passes lint and typecheck, builds, starts, and passes
its own tests before it ships. Versions are pinned exactly, with no carets, so two projects generated
a month apart are the same project.

## What lands in the project

| File | What it is |
|---|---|
| `.prumo/` | The conventions, in nine areas. Only the areas the answers call for are copied |
| `.prumo/INDEX.md` | One line per document. Generated by the tool, and safe to regenerate |
| `AGENTS.md` | The pointer into `.prumo/`, read by Codex, Cursor, Copilot, Gemini CLI and others |
| `CLAUDE.md` | An `@AGENTS.md` import, for Claude Code |

The nine areas are `core`, `api`, `database`, `client`, `web`, `mobile`, `site`, `monorepo` and
`multi-tenancy`. Only `core` ships unconditionally, because everything in it is true of every type;
the rest follow the answers, since advice about a platform the project does not have is worse than
no advice at all.

Once written, those documents belong to the team. Prumo does not come back and rewrite them.

## Where the rest is written

| Document | Holds |
|---|---|
| [`docs/stack.md`](https://github.com/stjosephworks/prumo/blob/main/docs/stack.md) | What is locked, what was deliberately dropped, and the version floors |
| [`docs/structure.md`](https://github.com/stjosephworks/prumo/blob/main/docs/structure.md) | The `.prumo/` layout, and the rule deciding which areas a project receives |
| [`docs/DECISIONS.md`](https://github.com/stjosephworks/prumo/blob/main/docs/DECISIONS.md) | Every decision, why it won, and what it costs |
| [`docs/OPEN-QUESTIONS.md`](https://github.com/stjosephworks/prumo/blob/main/docs/OPEN-QUESTIONS.md) | What has been raised and is still unresolved |

## Status

Prumo is in beta. `0.0.1` is the first published version: every template runs and every generated
project is verified in CI, and what a generated project looks like can still change before 1.0.
What is known to be missing is listed in [`docs/OPEN-QUESTIONS.md`](https://github.com/stjosephworks/prumo/blob/main/docs/OPEN-QUESTIONS.md), and
updating a project's `.prumo/` in place comes after 1.0.
